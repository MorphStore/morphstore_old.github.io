## Welcome to MorphStore

MorphStore is a regular in- memory column store with a novel compression-aware and highly vectroized query processing concept. The unique features of MorphStore are:
- support of a large variety of lightweight integer compression algorithms,
- a continuous handling of compression from base data to intermediate results, 
- a cost-based decision for the best-suited compression algorithm, 
- morphing intermediates from one compression scheme to an- other compression scheme to dynamically adapt the physical representation to the changing data characteristics during query processing.
